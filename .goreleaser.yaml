    summary: A utility for configuring dev/test machines for charm development
    description: |
      concierge is an opinionated utility for provisioning charm development and testing machines.

      Its role is to ensure that a given machine has the relevant "craft" tools and providers
      installed, then bootstrap a Juju controller onto each of the providers. Additionally, it can
      install selected tools from the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io) or the Ubuntu archive.

      Configuration is by flags/environment variables, or by configuration file. The configuration file
      must be in the current working directory and named 'concierge.yaml', or the path specified using
      the '-c' flag.

      There are 3 presets available by default: 'machine', 'k8s' and 'dev'.

      Some aspects of presets and config files can be overridden using flags such as '--juju-channel'.
      Each of the override flags has an environment variable equivalent, such as
      'CONCIERGE_JUJU_CHANNEL'.
