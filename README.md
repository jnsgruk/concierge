`concierge` is an opinionated utility for provisioning charm development and testing machines.

Its role is to ensure that a given machine has the relevant "craft" tools and providers installed,
then bootstrap a Juju controller onto each of the providers. Additionally, it can install selected
tools from the [snap store](https://snapcraft.io) or the Ubuntu archive.

`concierge` also provides the facility to "restore" a machine, performing the opposite to "prepare"
meaning that, for example, any snaps that would have been installed by `concierge`, would then be
removed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take care with `concierge restore`. If the machine already had a given snap or configuration
> prior to running `concierge prepare`, this will not be taken into account during `restore`.
> Running `concierge restore` is the literal opposite of `concierge prepare`, so any packages,
> files or configuration that would normally be created during `prepare` will be removed.

## Installation

The easiest way to consume `concierge` is using the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/concierge):

```shell
sudo snap install --classic concierge
```

Or, you can install `concierge` with the `go install` command:

```shell
go install github.com/jnsgruk/concierge@latest
```

Or you can clone, build and run like so:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jnsgruk/concierge
cd concierge
go build -o concierge main.go
sudo ./concierge -h
```

## Usage

The output of `concierge --help` can be seen below.

```

Some flags can be set by environment variable, and if specified by flag and environment variable,
the environment variable version will always take precedent. The equivalents are:

|            Flag            |              Env Var               |
| :------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |

### Command Examples

The best source of examples for how to invoke `concierge` can be found in the
[tests](./tests/) directory, but otherwise:

1. Run `concierge` using the `dev` preset, adding one additional snap, using CLI flags:

```bash
sudo concierge prepare -p dev --extra-snaps node/22/stable
```

2. Run `concierge` using the `dev` preset, overriding the Juju channel:

```bash
export CONCIERGE_JUJU_CHANNEL=3.6/beta
sudo concierge prepare -p dev
```

## Configuration

### Presets

`concierge` comes with a number of presets that are likely to serve most charm development needs:

| Preset Name | Included                                                                  |
| :---------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|    `dev`    | `juju`, `microk8s`, `lxd` `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`, `rockcraft`, `jhack` |
|    `k8s`    | `juju`, `k8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                           |
| `microk8s`  | `juju`, `microk8s`, `lxd`, `rockcraft`, `charmcraft`                      |
|  `machine`  | `juju`, `lxd`, `snapcraft`, `charmcraft`                                  |

Note that in the `microk8s`/`k8s` presets, while `lxd` is installed, it is not bootstrapped. It is
installed and initialised with enough config such that `charmcraft` can use it as a build backend.

### Config File

If the presets do not meet your needs, you can create your own config file to instruct `concierge`
how to provision your machine.

`concierge` takes configuration in the form of a YAML file named `concierge.yaml` in the current
working directory.

```

#### Providing Credentials Files

Juju has some "built-in" clouds for which it can obtain credentials automatically, such as LXD and MicroK8s. Other clouds require credentials for the bootstrap process.

Concierge handles this with the `credentials-file` option for supported providers.

Juju's credentials are specified in `~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml`, in the following format:

```yaml
credentials:
  <cloud-name>:
    <credential-name>:
      key: value
      key: value
```

For example, a pre-configured `credentials.yaml` might look like so where Google Cloud had already been configured:

```yaml
credentials:
  google:
    mycred:
      auth-type: oauth2
      client-email: juju-gce-1-sa@myname.iam.gserviceaccount.com
      client-id: "1234567891234"
      private-key: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        deadbeef
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
      project-id: foobar
```

When providing the path to a `credentials-file` for `concierge`, it should contain _only_ the details for a specific credential, so the example above would require a file like so:

```yaml
auth-type: oauth2
client-email: juju-gce-1-sa@myname.iam.gserviceaccount.com
client-id: "1234567891234"
private-key: |
  -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
  deadbeef
  -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
project-id: foobar
```

If you already have a `credentials.yaml` pre-populated with credentials, you can use `yq` to build the file for you, for example:

```bash
cat ~/.local/share/juju/credentials.yaml | yq -r '.credentials.google.mycred' > google-creds.yaml
```

In the above example `google-creds.yaml` would be valid for the `credentials-file` option.

#### Example Config

An example config file can be seen below:

```yaml
juju:
  channel: 3.5/stable
  model-defaults:
    test-mode: "true"
    automatically-retry-hooks: "false"

## Development / HACKING

This project uses [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to build and release, and `spread` for
integration testing,

You can get started by just using Go, or with `goreleaser`:

```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jnsgruk/concierge
cd concierge

# Build/run with Go
go run main.go

# Run the unit tests
go test ./...

# Build a snapshot release with goreleaser (output in ./dist)
goreleaser build --clean --snapshot
```

### Testing

Most of the code within tries to call a shell command, or manipulate the system in some way, which
makes unit testing much more awkward. As a result, the majority of the testing is done with
[`spread`](https://github.com/canonical/spread).

Currently, there are two supported backends - tests can either be run in LXD virtual machines, or
on a pre-provisioned server (such as a Github Actions runner or development VM).

To show the available integration tests, you can:

```bash
$ spread -list lxd:
lxd:ubuntu-24.04:tests/extra-debs
lxd:ubuntu-24.04:tests/extra-packages-config-file
lxd:ubuntu-24.04:tests/extra-snaps
# ...
```

From there, you can either run all of the tests, or a selection:

```bash
# Run all of the tests
$ spread -v lxd:
# Run a particular test
$ spread -v lxd:ubuntu-24.04:tests/juju-model-defaults
```

To run any of the tests on a locally provisioned machine, use the `github-ci` backend, e.g.

```bash
# List available tests
$ spread --list github-ci:
# Run all of the tests
$ spread -v github-ci:
# Run a particular test
$ spread -v github-ci:ubuntu-24.04:tests/juju-model-defaults
```
